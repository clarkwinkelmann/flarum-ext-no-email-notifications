This extension removes the Flarum email notification driver.

This removes all email notifications added by core or extensions.

The underlying user settings are left untouched.
If you disable this extension, the original user notification settings of each user will be used again.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-no-email-notifications

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
